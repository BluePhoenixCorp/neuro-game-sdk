## Neuro Game SDK

This repository contains the API documentation for allowing [Neuro-sama](https://twitch.tv/vedal987) to play games.

There are also SDKs available for [Unity] and [Godot]. If you would like to use the Neuro API in a different engine or programming language, you will have to implement the websocket protocol yourself. If you do so, consider opening a pull request to this repository to share your implementation with others.
